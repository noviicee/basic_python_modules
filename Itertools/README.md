What is Itertools in Python?
----------------------------

Itertools is a *module* in python, which is used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop.Such data structures are also known as iterables. This module incorporates functions that utilize computational resources efficiently.

According to the **itertools docs** [*itertools_docs*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) , it is a “module that implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML etc. Together, they form an 'iterator algebra' making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.”
