# basic_python_modules
This repository demonstrates the functions and usage of some basic modules present in python. These modules can prove to be useful while solving beginner level-questions at coding, or might even help in some advanced questions, where a lot of task is to be performed in a constraint of 'Time' and 'Space'.

>Note: Sometimes, while using some modules there may be a creation of an extra tuple, or maybe a list. In those cases, the *constant space complexity* cannot be fulfilled and we have to shift to the basics.
